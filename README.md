Setup:
1) Create a new database and import db.sql
2) Delete db.sql from root
3) Upload contents inside website root folder or subfolder
4) Enter setup.php
    (ex: http://website.ca/cpanel/setup.php)
5) Enter the following information needed and finish setup.

6) DELETE SETUP.PHP FROM ROOT FOLDER -- Failure to do so will allow your CMS to be overwritten by the general public.
7) Login, and finish profile setup.
8) Complete. Enjoy your new VTC.

General Tips/Warnings:
- Do not remove current-version.txt - This file helps determine if any new updates are available.
- Do not make anyone admin unless you trust them. Admins can delete valuable information such as users, jobs logs, incident reports, etc.
- I do not offer support to heavily modified versions. If you don't know how to code in PHP, don't mess with the files.

Dontations
- Payment is not required, nor will it ever be required.
  If you feel like making a donation, It will always be greatly appreciated. 
- If you make a donation equal to or greater than $1CAD you can follow this form () and include the necessary information to request a modified version of a page, or aspect. Nothing is guaranteed but I will try my best to get to everyone at a timely pace and fullfill your requests.
