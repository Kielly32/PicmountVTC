    (ex: http://website.ca/cpanel/setup.php)

General Tips/Warnings:
- Do not remove current-version.txt - This file helps determine if any new updates are available.
- Do not make anyone admin unless you trust them. Admins can delete valuable information such as users, jobs logs, incident reports, etc.
- I do not offer support to heavily modified versions. If you don't know how to code in PHP, don't mess with the files.

Dontations
- Payment is not required, nor will it ever be required.
